# Co-Clustering Deep Latent Block Model

%% Building ... %%

(explain the concept, inria project...)

The detailled of the theorical part of the model is in the file Co-Clustering_DLBM.pdf 

## model_generated_data.ipynb

This notebook contain the training of the model on data generated on the same generative model.

## LBM_generated_data.ipynb

This notebook contain the training of the model on data generated on the LBM generative model.

## movielens_data.ipynb

This notebook contain the training of the model on real data from movielens dataset.
Necessary files : 
Warning : the files is training on 20000 X 8000 size matrix and read files with more than 700M datapoint
For info on the dataset check : https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/
